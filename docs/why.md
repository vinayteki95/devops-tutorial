# If DevOps is a culture, how do you study for that ?

## What is Devops ?

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/):
  DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity

[WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps):
  DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

[MICROSOFT](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/):
  A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.

### Okay! What are we dealing with here ?

All the jargon above sounds to me like it's more of a culture (a pattern of behaviour) that a team of people practice to achieve optimal development lifecycle in the Tech industry.

### Then what/who is a DevOps engineer here ?

This is probably the coolest part for me. A DevOps engineer is someone who ensures and manages this culture with every resource out there.

Sounds like a lot of responsibility. That is why we have an **engineer** for that role. Some one who can understand, utilize and innovate with **technology** to make this happen.

### The learning strategy (Finally!!)

Go through the evolution of DevOps culture yourself in a simulated environment.

### What do you have to know to do that ?

I'm not going to go into the details of what DevOps is because there are 1000s of articles and tutorials out there for us to make the most out of.

We are here to explore the **learning strategy** to acquire the skills of a devops engineer in a more abstract format.

Let's speculate through a ficticious narrative of the evolution of devops in a company.

Everytime there is a new problem or scenario the DevOps guy changes the blueprint of the tech infrastructure.

We tried to demonstrate the tech architecture of a company and how it evolves in the illustration above.
  Note: there are quite a few missing pieces in the above illustration but it'll be impossible for one to go through all of them at once and I'll have to spend way too much time if I try to generate these illustrations for every possible scenario. 
  
  For example I skipped the GIT BRANCHING STRATEGY, DEPLOYMENT / ROLE OUT METHODS, DIFFERENT TYPES OF TESTING - UAT, SMOKE, INTEGRATION, etc.

It is clear that a company would go through such a transformation  organically by facing a new problem which manifests itself in the **Software Development Life Cycle** relm. All we need to do is simulate the same environment and actually implement the architecture required to solve the problem.

It is highly benificial to implement each phase of devops evolution rather than skipping to the last design. The reason is simple, a devops engineer will never be asked to build an entire pipeline at once. In fact one would have to modify the current infrastucture and introduce new technologies without disrupting the old flow without creating any downtimes at all.

### Conclusion:

The idea is straight forward here. The transition from being a sysadmin or a developer to a DevOps engineer on the fly is in itself the skill a DevOps engineer possess. Learning a new technology takes a day or few to master it where as it takes an organisation to technologically scale and mature to produce a DevOps engineer.
